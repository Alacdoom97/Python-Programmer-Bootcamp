The world isn't perfect. But it's there for us, doing the best it can....
that's what makes it so damn beautiful.

Fear is not evil. It tells you what weakness is.
And once you know your weakness,
you can become stronger as well as kinder.

Don’t give up, there’s no shame in falling down!
True shame is to not stand up again!
